1. Use contrasts to specify the comparison you wish to make. Run comparisons between KOa vs FFa and KOb vs FFa. 

2.  Perform differential expression analysis incorporating batch as additional factor. 

a) Find the number of genes that are changed because of condition at FDR 0.05.

b) Find the number of genes that are changed because of batch at FDR 0.05.


3. Repeat above analysis using likelihood ratio test instead of the wald test,

a) Find the number of genes that are changed because of condition at FDR 0.05.

b) Find the number of genes that are changed because of batch at FDR 0.05.

4. Introduce interaction in your design to to see if there is interaction between two factors involved in your design.
